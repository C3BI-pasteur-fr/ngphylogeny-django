# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

NGPhylogeny.fr is a Django front-end for phylogenetics analysis. **It does no
bioinformatics computation itself** — it's an orchestration/UI layer that
drives a separate **Galaxy server** (via the `bioblend` API client) to run
the actual tools (alignment, tree building, bootstrapping, BLAST, etc.). Any
change to a workflow, tool run, or job-status feature usually means tracing
through both this Django app *and* what it's asking the Galaxy server to do
— there's no local execution to fall back on for understanding behavior.

## Commands

Stack: Python 3.8, Django 4.2, Celery 5 + Redis.

```bash
# Install deps (numpy must land before biopython, which needs it at build time
# and doesn't declare it — a plain `pip install -r requirement.txt` can fail
# on a clean env depending on pip's resolution order)
pip install numpy==1.24.4
pip install -r requirement.txt

# Local dev DB: sqlite unless NGPHYLO_DATABASE_HOST is set (see settings/local.py)
python manage.py makemigrations   # migrations are NOT committed to git - see below
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createcachetable
python manage.py runserver

# Tests (currently: static-page + crispy/captcha rendering smoke tests in
# data/tests.py, Tool.can_run_on_data() boundary tests in tools/tests.py)
python manage.py test
python manage.py test data.tests.StaticPagesSmokeTest.test_pages_return_200   # single test

# Lint (matches CI exactly - narrow on purpose, this is a legacy codebase)
flake8 --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --exclude=migrations .

# DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE defaults to NGPhylogeny_fr.settings.local (see manage.py);
# production (wsgi.py) uses NGPhylogeny_fr.settings.prod instead.
```

GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) runs exactly `flake8` then
`makemigrations && migrate && check && test` on `python:3.8-buster`. There's
no Docker build/push/deploy stage yet.

### One-time / operational management commands

These aren't used in normal dev loops but are how the app gets linked to a
Galaxy server and populated with tools/workflows (see `startup.sh` for the
full bootstrap sequence used in Docker):

```bash
python manage.py creategalaxyserver --url=http://url_galaxy:port --activate
python manage.py addgalaxykey --user <username> --galaxyurl <url> --galaxykey <key>
python manage.py importtools --galaxyurl=<url> --query="phylogeny" --flags=toolflags.txt --inputfields=toolfields.txt
python manage.py import_links --linkfile=toollinks.txt
python manage.py importworkflows --galaxyurl=<url> --wfnamefile=wfnames.txt
```

## Architecture

### Migrations are not committed

`.gitignore` excludes `*/migrations/0*.py` (only `migrations/__init__.py` is
tracked). Both the `Dockerfile` and `startup.sh` run `makemigrations` fresh
on every build/container start. Don't expect `git log` on a migrations
directory to tell you anything, and always run `makemigrations` before
`migrate` in a fresh checkout.

### App responsibilities

- **`galaxy`** — `Server` (a configured Galaxy instance; `current=True` marks
  the one actually used — enforced as a singleton in `Server.save()`) and
  `GalaxyUser` (per-Django-user Galaxy API key, with an `anonymous=True` flag
  marking the shared key used for anonymous visitors). `galaxylib.py` wraps
  `bioblend.galaxy.GalaxyInstance`, adding Django-cache-backed GET caching
  and a `GalaxyInstanceAnonymous` variant that authenticates via a Galaxy
  session cookie instead of an API key (for anonymous users).
- **`tools`** — mirrors Galaxy's tool definitions locally (`Tool`,
  `ToolInputData`/`ToolOutputData` with EDAM format info, `Citation`,
  `ToolFlag`). `Tool.import_tool_io()` fetches live JSON from the Galaxy API
  to populate these on import. `Tool.can_run_on_data()` enforces
  per-tool size limits (max sequences, bootstrap replicates, etc.) before a
  job is allowed to run.
- **`workflows`** — `Workflow` mirrors a Galaxy workflow. The interesting
  piece is `WorkflowGalaxyFactory` (in `models.py`): given an ordered list of
  `Tool`s, it auto-chains them into Galaxy workflow JSON by matching
  EDAM input/output formats step-to-step, inserting a Galaxy
  `ChangeDatatypeAction` when formats don't quite match. Three submission
  UIs share this machinery: `views/wkoneclick.py` (preconfigured),
  `views/wkadvanced.py` (parametrized), `views/wkmaker.py` (build-your-own,
  drives `WorkflowGalaxyFactory` directly).
- **`workspace`** — `WorkspaceHistory` represents one Galaxy "history" (a
  job run): status, ownership, monitoring state. Celery tasks
  (`workspace/tasks.py`) poll Galaxy for job status and email the user on
  completion.
- **`blast`** — a parallel, mostly self-contained BLAST subsystem (own
  models, Celery tasks, pseudo-MSA construction in `msa.py`) supporting
  either the public NCBI API or an internal Pasteur Galaxy BLAST server
  (`settings.BLASTS` in `settings/base.py` configures both).
- **`data`** — `ExampleFile` plus generic file display/download/upload
  views shared across the other apps.
- **`account`**, **`surveys`** — thin (`account` has no models; it's
  login/API-key management. `surveys` is the feedback form).

### Async: Celery

Queues: `default`, `ncbi_blast`, `monitor` (routed via `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES`
in `settings/base.py`). Periodic jobs (old-history cleanup, BLAST run
monitoring, etc.) are declared in `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` in that same file —
**not** as `@periodic_task` decorators on the task functions (that API was
removed in Celery 5; the task functions are plain `@shared_task`). All
`CELERY_*` settings are read via
`app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')` in
`NGPhylogeny_fr/celery.py`, so a setting only takes effect if it has the
`CELERY_` prefix and the correct post-namespace name (e.g.
`CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE`, not `CELERY_DEFAULT_QUEUE`).

### Settings split

`NGPhylogeny_fr/settings/{base,local,prod}.py`. `DATABASES` lives in
`base.py` (env-var-based: `NGPHYLO_DATABASE_*` if `NGPHYLO_DATABASE_HOST` is
set, sqlite fallback otherwise) so both `local.py` and `prod.py` inherit the
same logic via `from .base import *`. `local.py` (the default — see
`manage.py`) additionally sets `DEBUG=True`; `prod.py` (used by `wsgi.py`)
sets `DEBUG=False`. Custom error templates (`templates/500.html` etc.) only
ever render when `DEBUG=False` — Django always shows the interactive
traceback otherwise, regardless of what templates exist, so reproducing a
production-looking error page locally means running with
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=NGPhylogeny_fr.settings.prod`, not `.local`.

### `dictsort` doesn't call methods

Django 3.1 hardened `dictsort`/`dictsortreversed` to stop auto-calling
methods in a lookup chain (`"foo.bar.baz"` where an intermediate step is a
method, e.g. a related-manager's `.first()`) — unlike normal template
variable resolution, which still auto-calls. A filter argument like
`dictsort:"toolflag_set.first.verbose_name"` will now silently resolve to
`""` instead of raising, so a `{% regroup %}`/`{% for %}` over it just
renders as empty — no error, no page-load failure, easy to miss entirely
unless the list actually has data (`tools/views.py`'s `ToolListView` hit
this rendering as a permanently-empty tools page; see git history for the
fix — precompute the value as a plain attribute in the view instead of
relying on dictsort to call anything).

### Known dependency ceilings (don't casually bump these)

- **`biopython==1.70`** is pinned and can't be bumped past Python 3.9: its
  `Bio.trie` C extension assigns through the `Py_TYPE()` macro, which CPython
  3.10 made illegal. Bumping biopython also means removing all
  `Bio.Alphabet` usage (`blast/msa.py`, `utils/biofile.py`,
  `blast/tasks.py`) since that module was removed in biopython ≥1.78. This
  is why the project is pinned to Python 3.8 rather than something newer.
- **`celery[redis]==5.4.0`**, **`bioblend==1.4.0`** were bumped from very old
  pins (4.4.7, 0.10) as part of this project's Python 2→3 / Django
  1.11→4.2 migration. `bioblend`'s actual runtime behavior has since been
  verified live against the real production Galaxy server (`galaxy.pasteur.fr`)
  — auth (moved from `?key=` query params to an `x-api-key` header),
  `get_tools`/`get_histories`, `Workflow.fetch_details()`/`show_workflow()`,
  and `Workflow.duplicate()` (`import_workflow_dict`) all confirmed working.

### Docker

Single container running nginx + uwsgi + redis + celeryd + celerybeat
together (via init.d scripts under `docker/`), bootstrapped by
`startup.sh`, which also seeds the DB, creates a superuser, and imports
tools/workflows from a Galaxy server on every container start — see that
script for the exact sequence if you need to reproduce it outside Docker.
