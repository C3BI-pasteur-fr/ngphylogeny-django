# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

NGPhylogeny.fr is a Django front-end for phylogenetics analysis. **It does no
bioinformatics computation itself** — it's an orchestration/UI layer that
drives a separate **Galaxy server** (via the `bioblend` API client) to run
the actual tools (alignment, tree building, bootstrapping, BLAST, etc.). Any
change to a workflow, tool run, or job-status feature usually means tracing
through both this Django app *and* what it's asking the Galaxy server to do
— there's no local execution to fall back on for understanding behavior.

## Commands

Stack: Python 3.8, Django 4.2, Celery 5 + Redis.

```bash
# Install deps (numpy must land before biopython, which needs it at build time
# and doesn't declare it — a plain `pip install -r requirement.txt` can fail
# on a clean env depending on pip's resolution order)
pip install numpy==1.24.4
pip install -r requirement.txt

# Local dev DB: sqlite unless NGPHYLO_DATABASE_HOST is set (see settings/local.py)
python manage.py makemigrations   # migrations are NOT committed to git - see below
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createcachetable
python manage.py runserver

# Tests (currently: static-page + crispy/captcha rendering smoke tests in
# data/tests.py, Tool.can_run_on_data() boundary tests in tools/tests.py)
python manage.py test
python manage.py test data.tests.StaticPagesSmokeTest.test_pages_return_200   # single test

# Lint (matches CI exactly - narrow on purpose, this is a legacy codebase)
flake8 --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --exclude=migrations .

# DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE defaults to NGPhylogeny_fr.settings.local (see manage.py);
# production (wsgi.py) uses NGPhylogeny_fr.settings.prod instead.
```

GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) runs exactly `flake8` then
`makemigrations && migrate && check && test` on `python:3.8-buster`. There's
no Docker build/push/deploy stage yet.

### One-time / operational management commands

These aren't used in normal dev loops but are how the app gets linked to a
Galaxy server and populated with tools/workflows (see `startup.sh` for the
full bootstrap sequence used in Docker):

```bash
python manage.py creategalaxyserver --url=http://url_galaxy:port --activate
python manage.py addgalaxykey --user <username> --galaxyurl <url> --galaxykey <key>
python manage.py importtools --galaxyurl=<url> --query="phylogeny" --flags=toolflags.txt --inputfields=toolfields.txt
python manage.py import_links --linkfile=toollinks.txt
python manage.py importworkflows --galaxyurl=<url> --wfnamefile=wfnames.txt
```

## Architecture

### Migrations are not committed

`.gitignore` excludes `*/migrations/0*.py` (only `migrations/__init__.py` is
tracked). Both the `Dockerfile` and `startup.sh` run `makemigrations` fresh
on every build/container start. Don't expect `git log` on a migrations
directory to tell you anything, and always run `makemigrations` before
`migrate` in a fresh checkout.

### App responsibilities

- **`galaxy`** — `Server` (a configured Galaxy instance; `current=True` marks
  the one actually used — enforced as a singleton in `Server.save()`) and
  `GalaxyUser` (per-Django-user Galaxy API key, with an `anonymous=True` flag
  marking the shared key used for anonymous visitors). `galaxylib.py` wraps
  `bioblend.galaxy.GalaxyInstance`, adding Django-cache-backed GET caching
  and a `GalaxyInstanceAnonymous` variant that authenticates via a Galaxy
  session cookie instead of an API key (for anonymous users).
- **`tools`** — mirrors Galaxy's tool definitions locally (`Tool`,
  `ToolInputData`/`ToolOutputData` with EDAM format info, `Citation`,
  `ToolFlag`). `Tool.import_tool_io()` fetches live JSON from the Galaxy API
  to populate these on import. `Tool.can_run_on_data()` enforces
  per-tool size limits (max sequences, bootstrap replicates, etc.) before a
  job is allowed to run.
- **`workflows`** — `Workflow` mirrors a Galaxy workflow. The interesting
  piece is `WorkflowGalaxyFactory` (in `models.py`): given an ordered list of
  `Tool`s, it auto-chains them into Galaxy workflow JSON by matching
  EDAM input/output formats step-to-step, inserting a Galaxy
  `ChangeDatatypeAction` when formats don't quite match. Three submission
  UIs share this machinery: `views/wkoneclick.py` (preconfigured),
  `views/wkadvanced.py` (parametrized), `views/wkmaker.py` (build-your-own,
  drives `WorkflowGalaxyFactory` directly).
- **`workspace`** — `WorkspaceHistory` represents one Galaxy "history" (a
  job run): status, ownership, monitoring state. Celery tasks
  (`workspace/tasks.py`) poll Galaxy for job status and email the user on
  completion.
- **`blast`** — a parallel, mostly self-contained BLAST subsystem (own
  models, Celery tasks, pseudo-MSA construction in `msa.py`) supporting
  either the public NCBI API or an internal Pasteur Galaxy BLAST server
  (`settings.BLASTS` in `settings/base.py` configures both).
- **`data`** — `ExampleFile` plus generic file display/download/upload
  views shared across the other apps.
- **`account`**, **`surveys`** — thin (`account` has no models; it's
  login/API-key management. `surveys` is the feedback form).

### Async: Celery

Queues: `default`, `ncbi_blast`, `monitor` (routed via `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES`
in `settings/base.py`). Periodic jobs (old-history cleanup, BLAST run
monitoring, etc.) are declared in `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` in that same file —
**not** as `@periodic_task` decorators on the task functions (that API was
removed in Celery 5; the task functions are plain `@shared_task`). All
`CELERY_*` settings are read via
`app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')` in
`NGPhylogeny_fr/celery.py`, so a setting only takes effect if it has the
`CELERY_` prefix and the correct post-namespace name (e.g.
`CELERY_TASK_DEFAULT_QUEUE`, not `CELERY_DEFAULT_QUEUE`).

### Settings split

`NGPhylogeny_fr/settings/{base,local,prod}.py`. `DATABASES` lives in
`base.py` (env-var-based: `NGPHYLO_DATABASE_*` if `NGPHYLO_DATABASE_HOST` is
set, sqlite fallback otherwise) so both `local.py` and `prod.py` inherit the
same logic via `from .base import *`. `local.py` (the default — see
`manage.py`) additionally sets `DEBUG=True`; `prod.py` (used by `wsgi.py`)
sets `DEBUG=False`. Custom error templates (`templates/500.html` etc.) only
ever render when `DEBUG=False` — Django always shows the interactive
traceback otherwise, regardless of what templates exist, so reproducing a
production-looking error page locally means running with
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=NGPhylogeny_fr.settings.prod`, not `.local`.

### `dictsort` doesn't call methods

Django 3.1 hardened `dictsort`/`dictsortreversed` to stop auto-calling
methods in a lookup chain (`"foo.bar.baz"` where an intermediate step is a
method, e.g. a related-manager's `.first()`) — unlike normal template
variable resolution, which still auto-calls. A filter argument like
`dictsort:"toolflag_set.first.verbose_name"` will now silently resolve to
`""` instead of raising, so a `{% regroup %}`/`{% for %}` over it just
renders as empty — no error, no page-load failure, easy to miss entirely
unless the list actually has data (`tools/views.py`'s `ToolListView` hit
this rendering as a permanently-empty tools page; see git history for the
fix — precompute the value as a plain attribute in the view instead of
relying on dictsort to call anything).

### Code paths only a real Galaxy run exercises

A full local Galaxy setup (any current version — verified against Galaxy
25.1, tools/workflows from `NGPhylogeny_fr_galaxytools` installed via its
`tool_conf.xml` + conda auto-install) surfaced three more Python 2→3 bugs
that `manage.py check`/`test` and synthetic bioblend calls never touch,
because they only trigger when a real workflow actually runs end to end:
- `requires_system_checks = True` (a bare bool) in `creategalaxyserver`,
  `addgalaxykey`, `importtools`, `importworkflows` — Django 4.x requires a
  list/tuple or the `'__all__'` sentinel here, not a bool. These commands
  are how a Galaxy server gets linked to the app at all (see the commands
  above), so this broke silently through every earlier phase.
- `Tool.import_tools()`'s citation text used to round-trip through
  `.encode('iso-8859-1').decode('utf8')` — a Python 2-era fix for a
  `requests`/`json` mojibake quirk that doesn't exist under Python 3
  (`requests.json()` already returns correctly-decoded text). Re-applying
  it crashed on any citation with a character outside Latin-1 (en dashes,
  curly quotes — both common in real citations), blocking most tool
  imports.
- `utils/biofile.py`'s `valid_fasta()` passed an uploaded file's binary
  handle straight to `Bio.SeqIO.parse()`. Biopython's `SimpleFastaParser`
  detects EOF by comparing a line to `""` (str), which never matches
  `b""` (bytes) under Python 3 — so parsing any real uploaded fasta file
  crashed with `IndexError` at the true end of the file, every time. Only
  worked in Python 2, where `bytes == str`. Fixed by reading the upload
  fully upfront and parsing through a text `io.StringIO` regardless of
  whether the source yields bytes or str.

With all three fixed, a real "PhyML" oneclick workflow submitted through
the actual UI ran for real against the local Galaxy: upload succeeds,
MAFFT/seqtype-detection/BMGE/PhyML execute as real (conda-installed)
Galaxy jobs. If you're touching upload/import/tool-linking code, don't
trust `manage.py test` alone — these paths need an actual Galaxy to run
against.

### Known dependency ceilings (don't casually bump these)

- **`biopython==1.70`** is pinned and can't be bumped past Python 3.9: its
  `Bio.trie` C extension assigns through the `Py_TYPE()` macro, which CPython
  3.10 made illegal. Bumping biopython also means removing all
  `Bio.Alphabet` usage (`blast/msa.py`, `utils/biofile.py`,
  `blast/tasks.py`) since that module was removed in biopython ≥1.78. This
  is why the project is pinned to Python 3.8 rather than something newer.
- **`celery[redis]==5.4.0`**, **`bioblend==1.4.0`** were bumped from very old
  pins (4.4.7, 0.10) as part of this project's Python 2→3 / Django
  1.11→4.2 migration. `bioblend`'s runtime behavior has since been verified
  live both against the real production Galaxy server (`galaxy.pasteur.fr`
  — auth moved from `?key=` query params to an `x-api-key` header,
  `get_tools`/`get_histories`, `Workflow.fetch_details()`/`show_workflow()`,
  `Workflow.duplicate()`/`import_workflow_dict`) and end to end against a
  local Galaxy 25.1 running a real oneclick workflow (see "Code paths only
  a real Galaxy run exercises" above) — both confirmed working.

### Docker

`docker compose up -d` runs five services from one lean `Dockerfile` (`db`
postgres, `redis`, `web`, `celery-worker`, `celery-beat` — no
nginx/uwsgi/compiled-redis bundled into the image, unlike the pre-2026
deployment). A one-shot `init` service (`docker/init.sh`) runs migrations,
seeds the admin user, and — only if `NGPHYLO_GALAXY_URL`/`NGPHYLO_GALAXY_KEY`
are set — links a Galaxy server and imports its tools/workflows, before
`web`/`celery-*` start (`depends_on: init: condition:
service_completed_successfully`); see that script for the exact command
sequence if reproducing it outside Docker. Verified end to end against a
from-scratch `docker compose up` — see README.md for deploy steps and the
Galaxy-linking env vars.

Two dockerignore gotchas worth knowing if this ever breaks again: unlike
`.gitignore`, a bare pattern in `.dockerignore` (`*.pyc`) only matches at the
build context *root*, not at any depth — nested files need the `**/` prefix
(`**/*.pyc`). And migrations/__init__.py must stay in the build context (only
the generated `0*.py` files are excluded, matching `.gitignore`) — excluding
the whole `*/migrations` directory silently breaks `makemigrations`'
auto-detection for every app that hasn't got a migration yet.
