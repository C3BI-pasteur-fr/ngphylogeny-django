    Regression test: WorkflowStepInformation.update_dict_tools() drops
    steps whose tool isn't locally known by deleting from
    self.steps_tooldict while iterating it. That relied on Python 2's
    dict.items() returning a list snapshot; under Python 3 (a live
    view), it raised "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during
    iteration" for any real Galaxy workflow containing a step this
    app's Tool table doesn't have a matching row for - only caught by
    testing against real (restored production) data, not by any of
    the existing unit tests, which never exercised the "unknown tool"
    branch.
